# HellForge Version Checklist
This is a checklist for each planned version planned for the HellForge Discord Bot. Versions are sorted from closest planned to furthest planned.

## HellForge Version Types
`Started` **DevRelease** - Planned: Already Started. <br>
Developer Release intended only for Developers as a very basic test release only accessible in https://discord.gg/coders or the HellForge Discord but expect many resets during this phase. Users who played this phase will get a very rare permanent item that will be useable in a later version. <br>
* HellForge Token Recipe <br>
*boosts all multipliers by 8x for 30 minutes.* <br>
`Unstarted` **Closed Alpha** - Planned: Q3 2023 <br>
More stable alpha still will only be usable in https://discord.gg/coders or the HellForge Support Servers. This Version is also your last chance to obtain: <br>
* HellForge Token Recipe <br>
*boosts all multipliers by 8x 30 minutes.* <br>
`Unstarted` **Alpha** - Planned: Q3 2023 <br>
Public alpha possible resets could happen but users who tried this version will be leaving with some unique permanent rewards! <br>
* Alpha Pickaxe + Recipe. <br>
* Alpha Lootbox Recipe. <br>
`Unstarted` **Beta** - Planned: Q3 2023 <br>
Public beta this will be the end of the resets and will include the addition of multiple areas and will mark the start of adding features that are not originally from HellForge v1. Users who played in this version will like alpha leave with some special permanent rewards! <br>
* Beta Pickaxe + Recipe. <br>
* Beta Lootbox Recipe. <br>
`Unstarted` **Pre-Release** - Q4 2023 <br>
Public pre release this will mark the start of more scheduled and consistent updates and will focus on optimising code to unsure fast responses from the bot, like the prior two version types this will have some permanent rewards. <br>
* The Well. (This is a unique version that will only be available to users we played either in Alpha, Beta or Pre Release.) <br>
* Resources (The Well): Alphatite, Betatite, Preite. <br>
* HellForge Pickaxe Recipe. <br>
`Unstarted` **Release** - Planned: Q1 2024 <br>
The full stable release for HellForge which will include the full checklist of features, content past this point is currently unknown. <br>
